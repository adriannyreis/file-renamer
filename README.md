# Folder and file renamer

Folder and file name renamer came up with the need to migrate documentation generated as markdown in Notion.

It removes all the hashes that are created when files are exported, facilitating the migration of these files to GitPages, because as the names are very long, GitPages does not allow the migration of files.

## How to use:
Paste the unzipped folder, rename it and to `doc` and run `go run .`
The lib will update all internal files and folders as well.
